# Roman Numerals Converter

Simple backend and frontend which converts an integer to roman numerals.

The backend is provided by NestJS, and the frontend by Vite. The frontend is served via the NestJS serve static module.

## Development

To run this project in development mode, proceed with the following steps.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ../backend
npm install
npm run start:dev
```

This will start the backend up on the configured port (default 3000), which is then accessible via the browser at `localhost:3000/index.html`.
